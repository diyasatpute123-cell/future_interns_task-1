Web Application Security Testing (WAST) is the process of identifying, analyzing, and remediating security vulnerabilities in web applications. The goal is to ensure that an application is secure against attacks such as data breaches, account takeover, injection, and other exploitation techniques.

🎯 Goals of Security Testing

Prevent unauthorized access

Protect user data

Maintain application integrity and availability

Comply with standards (OWASP, ISO 27001, PCI-DSS, etc.)

Reduce risk before deployment or during regular audits
